    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/temp-portfolio-pic.jpg" alt="picture of Steven Gresham"/>
    <p>
      My full name is Steven Joseph Gresham. I am 24 years old and I live in Yuma, AZ. I am passionate about coding and always looking to learn more. My interest in coding began in high school when I took a computer programming class my freshman year. Since then I have always tried to learn bit and pieces of it when i could. I didn't get back into some coding until my freshman year of college at ASU. Through the engineering program, I took a basic C++ coding class that I really enjoyed. I am excited to learn more whenever and however I can.
    </p>
    <p>Since college, I've been back in my home town, Yuma, and have been working at my family's restraunt, The Chile Pepper. I work there as a cashier lead and have been there for 4 years now. Outside of work, I play games with friends online and spend time with my family and girlfriend. Some hobbies of mine include D&D, Magic: The Gathering, building computers, reading, or watching some movies.</p>

      <h2>The Wise Canines</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first project I've worked on with a group. It is an application that pulls from two APIs and generates a picture of a dog and an inspirational quote by a famous author. It is designed to bring motivation and provide humor for the user. They are able to save favorite quotes and picture and recall them at a later time.
