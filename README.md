# Challenge 2
## Portfolio Project

## Description
This week's challenge involved making our portfolio that we will use to show of all of our projects, challenges, and any other tasks that we have worked throughout our bootcamp. It will inlude a section about myself and describe who I am briefly. It will have links to all my various projects and works. It will also have a section about my contact info.

I will contiune to work on and update this portfolio as the course goes on. I will include all that I learn form this course so that I may show off the skills I gain. For now, the portfolio will seem empty but in time it will grow and fill out to be a proper portfolio.
